My idea: Group all twitter data in toronto by month, do sentiment analysis, and average out by tweet, then compare month by month in a fun graph.


steps to do:
1) Get twitter data 
2) Sentiment analysis on all tweets
4) Create fun graph 


for each person
1.a) get data from past year, all tweets, t-1yr to today
b) put them into a text file
c) load text file into python, split words into list
